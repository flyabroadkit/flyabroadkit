        <p>The National Occupational Classification (NOC) 2016 is based on the NOC 2011 four-tiered hierarchical structure. The first level contains 10 broad occupational categories, the second level is made up of 40 major groups, the third level consists of 140 minor groups, and the last level comprises 500 unit groups.</p>
<p>The hierarchy and structure presented below allows you to drill down from one of the broad occupational categories to its associated unit groups and access the profile page of a unit group.</p>
<p>It is possible to select a previous version of the classification (NOC 2006 and 2011) as well as the upcoming version (NOC 2021). The NOC 2021 has been released for data collection purposes but will only be used by ESDC in late 2022.</p>
